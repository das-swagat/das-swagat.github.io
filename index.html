<h2>About</h2>
<p>
I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Virginia Commonwealth University, working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and cyber-physical systems. My research focuses on developing scalable, data-driven learning methods that bridge theoretical machine learning with real-world deployment in critical infrastructure, sensing, and intelligent systems.
</p>

<p>
I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant with the <strong>Modern Heuristics Research Group (MHRG)</strong>, contributing to interdisciplinary research projects in collaboration with national laboratories and industry partners. My work spans self-supervised and representation learning for anomaly detection, AI-enabled security for cyber-physical systems, and 3D LiDAR point-cloud segmentation for large-scale urban and environmental datasets.
</p>

<h2>Current Research & Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>EV Charging Infrastructure Health Monitoring (Idaho National Laboratory collaboration):</strong>
    Design and deployment of a real-time analytics dashboard for monitoring EV charger health, utilization, and reliability using large-scale sensor and geospatial data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Self-Supervised Learning for Cyber-Physical Systems:</strong>
    Development of SSL-based anomaly detection methods for multivariate time-series and networked CPS data, including CAN bus and infrastructure monitoring.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>3D LiDAR Point-Cloud Segmentation:</strong>
    AI-driven semantic segmentation of aerial and mobile LiDAR data for smart-city, urban planning, and environmental analysis applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>AI-Based Diagnostics:</strong>
    Integration of deep learning and self-supervised techniques for early-stage fault detection in sensor- and image-based diagnostic pipelines.
  </li>
</ul>
